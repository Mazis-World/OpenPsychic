No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. No Representative Actions. You and Open Psychic agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Open Psychic, and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. The limitations imposed by this section apply to, but are in no way limited to, class action refund claims brought by a class of taxpayers against Open Psychic related to taxes collected and remitted in good faith efforts at compliance with state and local marketplace facilitator or marketplace provider laws. Nothing in this section will be construed to prohibit a buyer from filing a refund claim with the seller or applicable state and local tax authority as permitted by law. Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Open Psychic seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Open Psychic seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Open Psychic waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.
